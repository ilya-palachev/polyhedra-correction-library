  abstract = {We address techniques for the estimation of convex polygons from
  support-line measurements and introduce the application of these methods to
  laser-radar data. The algorithms developed use varying degrees of prior
  information. Quantitative assessments of their performance with respect to
  various parameters are provided. As expected, prior information concerning
  object shape and orientation greatly improves performance. It is interesting
  that nearly the same performance is obtained with and without prior
  information about object orientation, and this enables us to extract an
  estimate of orientation. These convex-polygon estimation techniques are
  applied to the problem of target reconstruction from range-resolved and
  Doppler-resolved laser-radar data. The resulting reconstructions provide size
  and shape estimates of the targets under observation. Although such
  information can be obtained by other means (e.g., from reconstructed images
  using tomography), the present methods yield this information more directly.
  Furthermore, estimates obtained by using these methods are more robust to
  noisy or sparse measurement data and are much more robust to data suffering
  from registration errors. Finally, the present methods are used to improve
  tomographic images in the presence of registration errors.},
