  abstract = {Magnetic resonance signals that have very short relaxation times
  are conveniently sampled in a spherical fashion. We derive a least squares
  framework for reconstructing three-dimensional source distribution images
  from such data. Using a finite-series approach, the image is represented as a
  weighted sum of translated Kaiser-Bessel window functions. The Radon
  transform thereof establishes the connection with the projection data that
  one can obtain from the radial sampling trajectories. The resulting linear
  system of equations is sparse, but quite large. To reduce the size of the
  problem, we introduce focus of attention. Based on the theory of support
  functions, this data-driven preprocessing scheme eliminates equations and
  unknowns that merely represent the background. The image reconstruction and
  the focus of attention both require a least squares solution to be computed.
  We describe a projected gradient approach that facilitates a non-negativity
  constrained version of the powerful LSQR algorithm. In order to ensure
  reasonable execution times, the least squares computation can be distributed
  across a network of PCs and/or workstations. We discuss how to effectively
  parallelize the NN-LSQR algorithm. We close by presenting results from
  experimental work that addresses both computational issues and image quality
  using a mathematical phantom.},

  abstract = {We address techniques for the estimation of convex polygons from
  support-line measurements and introduce the application of these methods to
  laser-radar data. The algorithms developed use varying degrees of prior
  information. Quantitative assessments of their performance with respect to
  various parameters are provided. As expected, prior information concerning
  object shape and orientation greatly improves performance. It is interesting
  that nearly the same performance is obtained with and without prior
  information about object orientation, and this enables us to extract an
  estimate of orientation. These convex-polygon estimation techniques are
  applied to the problem of target reconstruction from range-resolved and
  Doppler-resolved laser-radar data. The resulting reconstructions provide size
  and shape estimates of the targets under observation. Although such
  information can be obtained by other means (e.g., from reconstructed images
  using tomography), the present methods yield this information more directly.
  Furthermore, estimates obtained by using these methods are more robust to
  noisy or sparse measurement data and are much more robust to data suffering
  from registration errors. Finally, the present methods are used to improve
  tomographic images in the presence of registration errors.},
