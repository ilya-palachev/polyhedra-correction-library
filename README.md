Polyhedra correction Library
============================

For more information see Introduction to the graduate work.
Polyhedron is a repository for correcttion spatial polyhedra 
that arrises from 3D-modeling of diamonds. Current methods 
for creating of 3D-models cause great calculation errors. 
So we need to have algorithms to correct them.

1). Some auxuliary techniques:

1.1). Intersection of polyhedron with plane (done)

2). Local correction

2.1). Joining nearest facets which have almost the same 
plane (done).

2.2). Moving one point and then the correction of polyhedron, 
because after movement flatness of some facets is corrupted 
(done).

3). Global correction.

3.1). Minimization of summary error of approximation (we are 
approximating shadow contours which appear during photographing 
the diamond) -- in progess.
