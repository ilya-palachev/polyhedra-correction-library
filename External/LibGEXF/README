FAQ:
  * Did you do a lot of testing on this?
    No, I tested the main methods to create a GEXF object, reading a GEXF file and writing one. 
    It seems to work, but you may use this library in a slightly different way than me and find unexpected behaviors.
    In this case please contact me :)

  * How much memory does it use?
    It depends on the graph you process! 
    The XML reading and writing are optimized (no DOM nor SAX), but the memory structure is a first sketch.

  * How much does this cost?
    $0.00 (It is free.)
