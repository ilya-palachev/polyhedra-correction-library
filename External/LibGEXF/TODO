TODO LIST

Major:

   * dynamic support
   * hyperarchical graphs support
   * phylogenic graphs support
   * list-string storage optimization (values replaced by corresponding idx) (LATER)
   * memory optimization (strings replaced by their real type like int) ; create a wrapper to access data? (LATER)

Minor:
   * Logger class for info(), warn() and err() messages
