@chapter Signal Processing


This chapter describes the signal processing and fast Fourier
transform functions available in Octave.  Fast Fourier transforms are
computed with the @sc{fftw} or @sc{fftpack} libraries depending on how
Octave is built.
 


@c detrend scripts/signal/detrend.m
@anchor{doc-detrend}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} detrend (@var{x}, @var{p})
If @var{x} is a vector, @code{detrend (@var{x}, @var{p})} removes the
best fit of a polynomial of order @var{p} from the data @var{x}.

If @var{x} is a matrix, @code{detrend (@var{x}, @var{p})} does the same
for each column in @var{x}.

The second argument is optional.  If it is not specified, a value of 1
is assumed.  This corresponds to removing a linear trend.

The order of the polynomial can also be given as a string, in which case
@var{p} must be either @t{"constant"} (corresponds to @code{@var{p}=0}) or
@t{"linear"} (corresponds to @code{@var{p}=1}).

@c fft src/DLD-FUNCTIONS/fft.cc
@anchor{doc-fft}
@deftypefn  {Loadable Function} {} fft (@var{x})
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {} fft (@var{x}, @var{n})
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {} fft (@var{x}, @var{n}, @var{dim})
Compute the discrete Fourier transform of @var{A} using
a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

The FFT is calculated along the first non-singleton dimension of the
array.  Thus if @var{x} is a matrix, @code{fft (@var{x})} computes the
FFT for each column of @var{x}.

If called with two arguments, @var{n} is expected to be an integer
specifying the number of elements of @var{x} to use, or an empty
matrix to specify that its value should be ignored.  If @var{n} is
larger than the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then
@var{x} is resized and padded with zeros.  Otherwise, if @var{n} is
smaller than the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then
@var{x} is truncated.

If called with three arguments, @var{dim} is an integer specifying the
dimension of the matrix along which the FFT is performed

Octave uses the @sc{fftw} libraries to perform FFT computations.  When Octave
starts up and initializes the @sc{fftw} libraries, they read a system wide
file (on a Unix system, it is typically @file{/etc/fftw/wisdom}) that
contains information useful to speed up FFT computations.  This
information is called the @emph{wisdom}.  The system-wide file allows
wisdom to be shared between all applications using the @sc{fftw} libraries.

Use the @code{fftw} function to generate and save wisdom.  Using the
utilities provided together with the @sc{fftw} libraries
(@command{fftw-wisdom} on Unix systems), you can even add wisdom
generated by Octave to the system-wide wisdom file.

@c fftw src/DLD-FUNCTIONS/fftw.cc
@anchor{doc-fftw}
@deftypefn  {Loadable Function} {@var{method} =} fftw ('planner')
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {} fftw ('planner', @var{method})
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {@var{wisdom} =} fftw ('dwisdom')
@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {} fftw ('dwisdom', @var{wisdom})

Manage @sc{fftw} wisdom data.  Wisdom data can be used to significantly
accelerate the calculation of the FFTs, but implies an initial cost
in its calculation.  When the @sc{fftw} libraries are initialized, they read
a system wide wisdom file (typically in @file{/etc/fftw/wisdom}), allowing
wisdom to be shared between applications other than Octave.  Alternatively,
the @code{fftw} function can be used to import wisdom.  For example,

@example
@var{wisdom} = fftw ('dwisdom')
@end example

@noindent
will save the existing wisdom used by Octave to the string @var{wisdom}.
This string can then be saved to a file and restored using the @code{save}
and @code{load} commands respectively.  This existing wisdom can be
reimported as follows

@example
fftw ('dwisdom', @var{wisdom})
@end example

If @var{wisdom} is an empty matrix, then the wisdom used is cleared.

During the calculation of Fourier transforms further wisdom is generated.
The fashion in which this wisdom is generated is also controlled by
the @code{fftw} function.  There are five different manners in which the
wisdom can be treated:

@table @asis
@item 'estimate'
Specifies that no run-time measurement of the optimal means of
calculating a particular is performed, and a simple heuristic is used
to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan.  The advantage of this method is
that there is little or no overhead in the generation of the plan, which
is appropriate for a Fourier transform that will be calculated once.

@item 'measure'
In this case a range of algorithms to perform the transform is considered
and the best is selected based on their execution time.

@item 'patient'
Similar to 'measure', but a wider range of algorithms is considered.

@item 'exhaustive'
Like 'measure', but all possible algorithms that may be used to
treat the transform are considered.

@item 'hybrid'
As run-time measurement of the algorithm can be expensive, this is a
compromise where 'measure' is used for transforms up to the size of 8192
and beyond that the 'estimate' method is used.
@end table

The default method is 'estimate'.  The current method can
be queried with

@example
@var{method} = fftw ('planner')
@end example

@noindent
or set by using

@example
fftw ('planner', @var{method})
@end example

Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when restarting Octave.  However,
the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is saved to a file as described
above.  Saved wisdom files should not be used on different platforms since
they will not be efficient and the point of calculating the wisdom is lost.

@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {} ifft (@var{x}, @var{n}, @var{dim})
Compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform of @var{A}
using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

The inverse FFT is calculated along the first non-singleton dimension
of the array.  Thus if @var{x} is a matrix, @code{fft (@var{x})} computes
the inverse FFT for each column of @var{x}.

If called with two arguments, @var{n} is expected to be an integer
specifying the number of elements of @var{x} to use, or an empty
matrix to specify that its value should be ignored.  If @var{n} is
larger than the dimension along which the inverse FFT is calculated, then
@var{x} is resized and padded with zeros.  Otherwise, if @var{n} is
smaller than the dimension along which the inverse FFT is calculated,
then @var{x} is truncated.

If called with three arguments, @var{dim} is an integer specifying the
dimension of the matrix along which the inverse FFT is performed

Compute the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of @var{A} using
a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

The optional arguments @var{m} and @var{n} may be used specify the
number of rows and columns of @var{A} to use.  If either of these is
larger than the size of @var{A}, @var{A} is resized and padded with

Compute the N-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of @var{A} using
a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

The optional vector argument @var{size} may be used specify the
dimensions of the array to be used.  If an element of @var{size} is
smaller than the corresponding dimension of @var{A}, then the dimension of
@var{A} is truncated prior to performing the FFT@.  Otherwise, if an element
of @var{size} is larger than the corresponding dimension then @var{A}
is resized and padded with zeros.

Convolve two vectors using the FFT for computation.

@code{c = fftconv (@var{x}, @var{y})} returns a vector of length equal to
@code{length (@var{x}) + length (@var{y}) - 1}.
If @var{x} and @var{y} are the coefficient vectors of two polynomials, the
returned value is the coefficient vector of the product polynomial.

The computation uses the FFT by calling the function @code{fftfilt}.  If
the optional argument @var{n} is specified, an N-point FFT is used.

@c fftfilt scripts/signal/fftfilt.m

With two arguments, @code{fftfilt} filters @var{x} with the FIR filter
@var{b} using the FFT.

Given the optional third argument, @var{n}, @code{fftfilt} uses the
overlap-add method to filter @var{x} with @var{b} using an N-point FFT.

If the fourth argument @var{si} is provided, it is taken as the
initial state of the system and the final state is returned as
@var{sf}.  The state vector is a column vector whose length is
equal to the length of the longest coefficient vector minus one.
If @var{si} is not supplied, the initial state vector is set to all

@anchor{doc-freqz}
@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{h}, @var{w}] =} freqz (@var{b}, @var{a}, @var{n}, "whole")
Return the complex frequency response @var{h} of the rational IIR filter
whose numerator and denominator coefficients are @var{b} and @var{a},
respectively.  The response is evaluated at @var{n} angular frequencies
between 0 and
@ifnottex
 2*pi.
@end ifnottex
@tex
 $2\pi$.
@end tex

@noindent
The output value @var{w} is a vector of the frequencies.

If the fourth argument is omitted, the response is evaluated at
frequencies between 0 and
@ifnottex
 pi.
@end ifnottex
@tex
 $\pi$.
@end tex

If @var{n} is omitted, a value of 512 is assumed.

If @var{a} is omitted, the denominator is assumed to be 1 (this
corresponds to a simple FIR filter).

For fastest computation, @var{n} should factor into a small number of
small primes.

@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{h} =} freqz (@var{b}, @var{a}, @var{w})
Evaluate the response at the specific frequencies in the vector @var{w}.
The values for @var{w} are measured in radians.

@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@dots{}] =} freqz (@dots{}, @var{Fs})
Return frequencies in Hz instead of radians assuming a sampling rate
@var{Fs}.  If you are evaluating the response at specific frequencies
@var{w}, those frequencies should be requested in Hz rather than radians.

@deftypefnx {Function File} {} freqz (@dots{})
Plot the pass band, stop band and phase response of @var{h} rather
than returning them.
@end deftypefn


@c freqz_plot scripts/signal/freqz_plot.m

@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{b} =} unwrap (@var{x}, @var{tol})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{b} =} unwrap (@var{x}, @var{tol}, @var{dim})

Unwrap radian phases by adding multiples of 2*pi as appropriate to
remove jumps greater than @var{tol}.  @var{tol} defaults to pi.

Unwrap will work along the dimension @var{dim}.  If @var{dim}
is unspecified it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{a}, @var{b}] =} arch_fit (@var{y}, @var{x}, @var{p}, @var{iter}, @var{gamma}, @var{a0}, @var{b0})
Fit an ARCH regression model to the time series @var{y} using the
scoring algorithm in Engle's original ARCH paper.  The model is

@example
@group
y(t) = b(1) * x(t,1) + @dots{} + b(k) * x(t,k) + e(t),
h(t) = a(1) + a(2) * e(t-1)^2 + @dots{} + a(p+1) * e(t-p)^2

in which @math{e(t)} is @math{N(0, h(t))}, given a time-series vector
@var{y} up to time @math{t-1} and a matrix of (ordinary) regressors
@var{x} up to @math{t}.  The order of the regression of the residual
variance is specified by @var{p}.

If invoked as @code{arch_fit (@var{y}, @var{k}, @var{p})} with a
positive integer @var{k}, fit an ARCH(@var{k}, @var{p}) process,
i.e., do the above with the @math{t}-th row of @var{x} given by

@example
[1, y(t-1), @dots{}, y(t-k)]

Optionally, one can specify the number of iterations @var{iter}, the
updating factor @var{gamma}, and initial values @math{a0} and
@math{b0} for the scoring algorithm.

@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{lm}] =} arch_test (@var{y}, @var{x}, @var{p})
For a linear regression model

@example
y = x * b + e
@end example

@noindent
perform a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test of the null hypothesis of no
conditional heteroscedascity against the alternative of CH(@var{p}).

I.e., the model is

@example
y(t) = b(1) * x(t,1) + @dots{} + b(k) * x(t,k) + e(t),
@end example

@noindent
given @var{y} up to @math{t-1} and @var{x} up to @math{t},
@math{e}(t) is @math{N(0, h(t))} with

@example
h(t) = v + a(1) * e(t-1)^2 + @dots{} + a(p) * e(t-p)^2,
@end example

@noindent
and the null is @math{a(1)} == @dots{} == @math{a(p)} == 0.

If the second argument is a scalar integer, @math{k}, perform the same

@example
[1, y(t-1), @dots{}, y(t-@var{k})]
@end example

@noindent
as the @math{t}-th row of @var{x}.

Under the null, LM approximately has a chisquare distribution with
@var{p} degrees of freedom and @var{pval} is the @math{p}-value (1
minus the CDF of this distribution at LM) of the test.

If no output argument is given, the @math{p}-value is displayed.

The optional parameter @var{n} gives the number of dummy

@c diffpara scripts/signal/diffpara.m
@anchor{doc-diffpara}
@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{d}, @var{dd}] =} diffpara (@var{x}, @var{a}, @var{b})
Return the estimator @var{d} for the differencing parameter of an
integrated time series.

The frequencies from @math{[2*pi*a/t, 2*pi*b/T]} are used for the
estimation.  If @var{b} is omitted, the interval
@math{[2*pi/T, 2*pi*a/T]} is used.  If both @var{b} and @var{a} are
omitted then @math{a = 0.5 * sqrt (T)} and @math{b = 1.5 * sqrt (T)}
is used, where @math{T} is the sample size.  If @var{x} is a matrix,
the differencing parameter of each column is estimated.

The estimators for all frequencies in the intervals
described above is returned in @var{dd}.  The value of @var{d} is
simply the mean of @var{dd}.

@anchor{doc-fftshift}
@deftypefn  {Function File} {} fftshift (@var{x})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} fftshift (@var{x}, @var{dim})
Perform a shift of the vector @var{x}, for use with the @code{fft}
and @code{ifft} functions, in order the move the frequency 0 to the
center of the vector or matrix.

If @var{x} is a vector of @math{N} elements corresponding to @math{N}
time samples spaced by @math{dt}, then
@code{fftshift (fft (@var{x}))} corresponds to frequencies

@example
f = [ -(ceil((N-1)/2):-1:1)*df 0 (1:floor((N-1)/2))*df ]
@end example

@noindent
where @nospell{@math{df}} = 1 / @math{dt}.

If @var{x} is a matrix, the same holds for rows and columns.  If
@var{x} is an array, then the same holds along each dimension.

The optional @var{dim} argument can be used to limit the dimension
along which the permutation occurs.

Return the Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (pchip) of
points @var{x} and @var{y}.

If called with two arguments, return the piecewise polynomial @var{pp}
that may be used with @code{ppval} to evaluate the polynomial at specific
points.  When called with a third input argument, @code{pchip} evaluates
the pchip polynomial at the points @var{xi}.  The third calling form is
equivalent to @code{ppval (pchip (@var{x}, @var{y}), @var{xi})}.

The variable @var{x} must be a strictly monotonic vector (either
increasing or decreasing) of length @var{n}.  @var{y} can be either a
vector or array.  If @var{y} is a vector then it must be the same length
@var{n} as @var{x}.  If @var{y} is an array then the size of @var{y} must
have the form
@tex
$$[s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_k, n]$$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@code{[@var{s1}, @var{s2}, @dots{}, @var{sk}, @var{n}]}

dimension is given by
@tex
$$s_1 s_2 \cdots s_k$$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@code{@var{s1} * @var{s2} * @dots{} * @var{sk}}
@end ifnottex
and each row of this matrix is then treated separately.  Note that this
is exactly opposite to @code{interp1} but is done for @sc{matlab}
compatibility.
