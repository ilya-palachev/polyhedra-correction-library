@node GUI Development
@chapter GUI Development

Octave is principally a batch or command-line language.  However, it does
offer some limited features for constructing graphical interfaces for
interacting with users.

The GUI elements available are I/O dialogs and a progress bar.  For example,
rather than hardcoding a filename for output results a script can open a dialog
box and allow the user to choose a file.  Similarly, if a calculation is
expected to take a long time a script can display a progress bar.

Several utility functions make it possible to store private data for use with
a GUI which will not pollute the user's variable space.

Finally, a program written in Octave might want to have long term storage of
preferences or state variables.  This can be done with user-defined
preferences.

@menu
* I/O Dialogs::       
* Progress Bar::       
* GUI Utility Functions::       
* User-Defined Preferences::       
@end menu

@node I/O Dialogs
@section I/O Dialogs

Simple dialog menus are available for choosing directories or files.  They
return a string variable which can then be used with any command requiring
a file name.

@node GUI Utility Functions
@section GUI Utility Functions

These functions do not implement a GUI element but are useful when developing
programs that do.  @strong{Warning:} The functions @code{uiwait},
@code{uiresume}, and @code{waitfor} are only available for the FLTK tooolkit.
